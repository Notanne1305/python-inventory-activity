#Activity title: python-inventory-activity
#Problem description
This inventory management system addresses the need for a simple yet robust solution to track product information using fundamental Python data structures. The program implements a menu-driven interface that allows users to efficiently manage item records by maintaining item names in a list and their corresponding prices in a dictionary. Key challenges include preventing duplicate entries, validating user inputs, and ensuring data consistency between the two data structures. The system incorporates comprehensive error handling to manage invalid price entries, non-existent items during updates, and menu selection errors, while specifically excluding deletion and stock-tracking features to maintain focus on core inventory management operations. Through the use of loops, conditionals, and exception handling, the program provides a reliable platform for basic inventory control while demonstrating practical application of Python programming concepts.
